# About

This "theme" by Ryan W. Moore is actually intended to be modified with a
Twitter Bootstrap theme of your choice. Twitter Bootstrap is a framework to
create websites that work and look great in a range of devices and browsers.
It's quite customizable and there's many themes available for free and/or pay. 

# License

This DokuWiki theme is based off of the DokuWiki Starter template, released
under GPL v2.0. Therefore, this template is also released under that license.
I've modified the starter template to make use of Twitter Bootstrap
code/functionality. Twitter Bootstrap is licensed under Apache License v2.0.
According to http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html , the Free
Software Foundation does not consider GPL2 to be compatible with Apache 2.0. I
don't really know how much it matters to the average user. Consult a lawyer if
you're worried about this incompatibility. 

# Customization

This DokuWiki theme will get you started with a very basic Twitter Boostrap
theme. Then, replace the following files with your own Bootstrap files:

css:
bootstrap.min.css
bootstrap-responsive.min.css

img:
glyphicons-halflings.png
glyphicons-halflings-white.png

js:
bootstrap.min.js

## Warning

This theme only supports minified CSS/javascript. 


# Base Version

This theme is based off of Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.
